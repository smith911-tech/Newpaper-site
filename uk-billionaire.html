        UK billionaire numbers rise by 20% since pandemic as cost of living crisis deepens</h2>
        <img src="./image/news-image/uk-blog-img1.jpeg" alt="img">
            <h3 id="uk-text">The number of billionaires in the UK has risen by 20 per cent since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, new research
            reveals.
            <br><br>
            The Equality Trust found that the number of billionaires increased from 147 in 2020 to 177 this year despite the ongoing
            cost of living crisis, with the average billionaire having around £2bn in wealth.
            <br><br>
            The equality charity has said the rise of billionaires in Britain is a “national disgrace” and comes as some families
            are forced to <span id="red"> choose between heating and eating because of the soaring</span> cost of gas and electricity.</h3>
    
    <h2><img id="second-img-blog" src="./image/news-image/uk-blog-news-2.jpeg" alt="">Jo Wittams, co-executive director of the Equality Trust, said: “The UK’s record on wealth inequality is appalling,
    grossly unjust, and presents a real threat to our <span id="red"> economy </span> and to our society.”
    <br><br>
    The charity said interventions by the government and banks during the pandemic allowed for an “explosion of billionaire
    wealth” after interest rates plummeted causing asset prices to rise.
    <br><br>
    “This sudden explosion in extreme wealth was in large part due to measures aimed at lessening the impact of Covid-19 on
    the economy, as central banks pumped trillions of dollars into financial markets, leading to a stock market boom which
    effectively lined the pockets of shareholders,” said Ms Wittams.
    <br><br>
    “While Covid-19 saw billionaire wealth rise to levels never seen before,<span id="red"> the construction of the economic infrastructure </span>
    that has enabled this mass accumulation stretches back over the last four decades.”</h2>
