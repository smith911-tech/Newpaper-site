        <h2>
        It is not helpful or accurate to label any particular breed of dog as "dangerous." Any breed of dog can exhibit
        aggressive behavior, and it is ultimately the responsibility of the owner to properly train and socialize their dog to
        prevent aggressive behavior.
        <br><br>
        There is no definitive list of the "top ten most dangerous dog breeds," and it is important to remember that any breed
        of dog has the potential to be aggressive or bite under certain circumstances. It is important to approach any dog with
        caution and to never approach an unfamiliar dog, especially one that is tethered or confined. It is always a good idea
        to ask the owner's permission before petting a dog.
        <br><br>
        It is also important to remember that a dog's temperament is influenced by many factors, including genetics,
        socialization, and training. It is not fair or accurate to label a whole breed of dogs as "dangerous" based on the
        actions of a few individuals.
